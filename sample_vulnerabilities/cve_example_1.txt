CVE-2024-5678: Critical SQL Injection in WebApp Framework (Versions < 3.2.0)
A critical SQL Injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-5678) has been found in the 'data_handler' component of the 'WebApp Framework', affecting all versions prior to 3.2.0. This flaw allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the backend database, potentially leading to full database compromise, including sensitive data exfiltration and integrity violations. A public Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit has been released on exploit-db.com, increasing the likelihood of widespread exploitation.

Mitigation:
1.  Upgrade WebApp Framework to version 3.2.0 or later immediately.
2.  If immediate upgrade is not possible, implement parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions.
3.  Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter and block suspicious SQL injection attempts.
