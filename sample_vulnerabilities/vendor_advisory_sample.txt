Fortinet FortiGate OS Vulnerability Advisory - FG-IR-24-001 (Unauthenticated RCE)
A critical unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability (FG-IR-24-001) has been discovered in Fortinet FortiGate appliances running FortiGate OS versions 7.0.0 through 7.2.4. This vulnerability resides in the administrative interface and allows a remote attacker, without authentication, to execute arbitrary commands on the device. This poses an extreme risk to network perimeter security. Fortinet has observed limited, targeted exploitation attempts in the wild.

Fortinet strongly recommends immediate patching. Firmware versions with fixes:
- FortiGate OS 7.0.5 or later (for 7.0.x branch)
- FortiGate OS 7.2.5 or later (for 7.2.x branch)
- FortiGate OS 7.4.1 or later (for 7.4.x branch)

Workaround:
If immediate patching is not possible, disable the administrative interface access from untrusted networks and enable strong authentication (MFA) for all administrative access.
